## Disclaimer

These resources are *only* **meant for ethical hacking**, unethical hacking is **strictly forbidden** and can lead to criminal charges. **Only hack a environment or program if you are given permission**, like a pen test or CTF.

## Overview

This repository **consists of solutions to the library of binary exploitation CTFs called Protostar** created by Exploit.Education.

These **CTFs are a great, structured way to learn the basics of binary exploitation and ethical hacking**, so for anyone getting into binary exploitation and reverse engineering I highly recommend these resources.

## Layout

**Each challenge has two files**, helping you out on your exploitation journey:

* `exploit.py`: A Python2 (Protostar does not support Python3) file that exploits the binary. Every memory address will be the same since [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) is disabled on Protostar.

* `solution.md`: A `.md` file containing every single step to get there, also containing resources for things like shellcode and other solutions.

## Contributing

**Feel free to contribute to this project!** Issues, pull requests, and more are appreciated!
